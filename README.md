# Experiment-2- To study and implement C++ Program Structure (Data Types)

Aim -> To study and implement C++ Program Structure (Data Types).

Theory -> Data types tell the variables about the type of data that they can store.
C++ supports many data types such as: 
1. Primary data types
2. Defined data types
3. User-defined data types

To find the size of data type we use "sizeof" command. It tells about the number of bytes occupied by any variable in the memory of a computer.

Storage class in C++ determines the characteristics of a variable.
C++ has 6 types of storage classes: 
1. Auto
2. Extern
3. Mutable
4. Register
5. Static

Conclusion -> I learnt about different data types and storage classes of C++.
