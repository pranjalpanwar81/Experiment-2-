# Experiment---2

Aim -> To study and implement C++ Program Structure (Data Types). <br> 

Theory -> Data types tell the variables about the type of data that they can store. <br> 
          C++ supports many data types such as: 1. Primary data types <br> 
                                                2. Defined data types<br> 
                                                3. User-defined data types <br> 
          To find the size of data type we use "sizeof" command. It tells about the number of bytes occupied by any variable in the memory of a computer. <br> 
          Storage class in C++ determines the characteristics of a variable. <br> 
          C++ has 6 types of storage classes: 1. Auto<br> 
                                              2. Extern<br> 
                                              3. Mutable<br> 
                                              4. Register<br> 
                                              5. Static<br>

COnclusion -> I learnt about different data types and storage classes of C++.
